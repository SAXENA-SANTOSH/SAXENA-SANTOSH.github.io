# Python data types, variables and I/O operations 

[![](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)](https://www.python.org/)


## Abstract
This blog contains the necessary details to get familiar with python variables, data types along with IO operations. By clicking on the above python logo anyone can be redirected to the official python page for better understanding. The topics covered in this blog are as follows. 

1. Python data types.
2. Python variables.
3. Demonstration relation between variables and data types. 
4. I/O operations in python.

## Python data types 

Data is defined as a set of facts that can be converted into meaningful information. Data type refers to the type of that data. 

For example, Rahul has born at 10th july 2000. On 10th July 2025, Rahul has aged to 25 years old. In this example the type of date of birth is a date whereas age is a numeric data type. Both the data are giving the same information but the type on which it is represented it different. 

List of data types python has is as follows : 

1. **Basic data types** : It is a fundamental data types stores only one information at a time. 
    1. **str** : It is known as `string` data type. It contains a set of characters. 
    2. **int** : It is known as `integer` data type. It contains integer data. It has a range from -&infin; to +&infin; excluding decimals. 
    3. **float** : It is known as `float` data type. It contains numeric data. It has a range from -&infin; to +&infin; including decimals 
    4. **bool** : It is known as `boolean` data type. It contains binary digits named as `True` and `False`. 
    5. **complex** : It is known as `complex` data type. It contains both real and imaginary units in the data. 
2. **Derived data types** : These data types is the collections of basic data types. 
    1. **list** : List is the collection of hetogeneous elements. Each elements must have anyone basic data type. List are mutable, means it can be modified at any given instance. 
    2. **tuple** : Tuple is the collection of hetrogeneous element. Each elements must have anyone basic data type. Tuple are immutable, means it cannot be modified at any given instance. It can either be created or deleted. 
    3. **dict** : It is known as dictionary data type that contains key vaule pair. Both key and value must have anyone basic data type. dict are mutable.  
    4. **set** : Set data types arrange elements in a specific orders and removes duplicate. 

## Variables 

Variable is an entity or storage identifier that stores the data assigned to it. When a variable is created, It is associated with some data. The data gets allocated in the RAM of the system. A responsibility of a variable is to point the data allocated in the RAM so that user can access the data at a given point of time. The rules to declare a variable is as follows. 

1. Variable must not be any data type of python keyword. 
2. Variable firt letter must not be any number or special character other than `_` 
3. variable name must not be amiguous. It must specify what data that specific variable is pointing/holding. 
4. variable name should not contain name in between. 


## Demonstration relation between variables and data types

> NOTE : `#` is used for comments and whatever is written after `#` will not be interpreted for interpreter. It is used to document any coding information for developers. 

### Variable initialization
```python 
name = "santosh" # Variable name is holding string data type i.e santosh. 
age = 24 # Variable age is holding integer data type i.e 24. 
weight_kg = 65.8  # Variable weight_kg is holding a float data type i.e 65.8.
is_adult = True # variable is_adult is holding a boolean data type. 
complex_no = 3 + 4j # variable complex_no is holding complex data type. 
```

Below are the examples that represents which type of variable declaration is valid. 
```python 
# Valid variable declaration 
date_of_birth = "2022-01-01"
_name = "Santosh Saxena" 

# Invalid variable declaration 
1st_planet = "Mercury" # First letter of variable is numeric.
@_mail =  "abc.def@gmail.com" # First letter has a special character other than _.

type = 24 # type variable is also a python keyword.
# if python keywords are used for variable declaration 
# then the functionalities associated with those keywords cannot be used. 
```


## I/O operations in python
I/O operations refers to input and output operations. Their are two inbuilt fundamental function in python responsible for input and output. 

> 1. input : To take input from the user. 
> 2. print : To provide an output to the user.

The code that demonstrate I/O operations are as follows 
```python 
# To take input from the user and store the data in a variable. 
# It provides all the input with string data type. 
name = input("Enter the name of the user")

# To display the data available in a variable. 
# It only print the data as a text format either on console or after the code cell. 
# Multple data/variable can be displayed at once delimited by ','.
print("Hello world")
print("Hello world, My name is : " , name) 
```

Input section is as follows
```
Enter the name of the user : Santosh
```

Output section is as follows
```
Hello world
Hello world, My name is : Santosh
```

If data of multiple print statement to be displayed at one line then end parameter has to be configured.This is set to new line by default. Hence if this has to be changed then `end` parameter has to be reconfigured. Example of python code is as follows. 

```python 
print('Hello world' , end = ' : ')
print("This is Santosh Saxena.")
print("Displayed in new line because `end` in above print statement is not configured.")
```

Output of the code is as follows 
```
Hello world : This is Santosh Saxena.
Displayed in new line because `end` in above print statement is not configured.
```

## Summary
In this blog we have covered the following topics. 

1. Basic understaning on python variables and data types
2. basic I/O operation in python. 

Next blog is all about building a deep understaing of python data types, variables in python.
