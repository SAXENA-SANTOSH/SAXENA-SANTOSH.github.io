[![](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)](https://www.python.org/)


## Abstract
This blog contains the necessary details to get start with python. By clicking on the above python logo anyone can be redirected to the official python page for better understanding. The topics covered in this blog are as follows. 

1. Installation of Python.
2. Introduction to Python.
3. Getting started with Python.


## Installation of Python. 
**Pythhon** is easy to install. Please find the required details related to installation of python and accessories below.  

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
3. [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)


## Intoduction to Python 
**Python** is a **high level language** that is easy to learn, read and write. It was created by **Guido van rossum**. It was released in the year **1991**. It is an ideal programming language to start up the programming journey. Majority of the keywoards in python are also available in english language. It is an **Interpreted language** and not a Compiled language. Interpreted langugare refers to the line by line execution of the code whereas compiler language converts overall code into bytes or executable file before execution. Python is **platform independent**, means it can be executed in multiple operating system (OS) like Windows, Mac, Linux etc. It supports multiple **programming paradigm** i.e procedural, functional, object oriented. Python is majorly opted in the domains of data because it huge large standard library responsible to solve complex problems.  


## Getting started with Python
This section is dedicated to demonstrate how to provide results to the user i.e output. The very basic operation due to which we can showcase an output to the user is **print** function. We can pass data or variable of any type in this function to get displayed. We will cover variable and data type in `Data and variables in Python`, Hence it is requested to focus only on how print statement is working. We will get to know more about print function in `I/O operations in python`. This will help readers to test whether the installation is successful or not. 


```python
print('Hello World')
```
The output of the above code is as follows 
```
'Hello World'
```

## Summary
In this blog we have covered the following topics. 

1. Installation of Python. 
2. Introductory details of Python.
3. Getting started with Python.

Next blog is all about basic understaing of python by getting familiar with basic data types, variable declaration and how to perform IO operations in python.
